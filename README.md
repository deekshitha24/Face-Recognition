# Face-Recognition

BIOMETRIC SENSING SYSTEM:

Biometric sensing systems have revolutionized the field of computer graphics by providing a novel and efficient way to capture, analyze, and interpret human physiological and behavioral characteristics. These systems leverage advanced technologies to measure unique biological traits such as fingerprints, facial features, iris patterns, and even voice signatures. In the context of computer graphics, biometric sensing enhances user interaction, security, and personalization by enabling devices and applications to recognize and respond to individuals in real time.

Face Recognition :

A face recognition system is one type of biometric computer application that can identify or verify a person from a digital image by comparing and analyzing patterns. These biometric systems are used in security systems. Present facial recognition systems work with face prints and these systems can recognize 80 nodal points on a human face. Nodal points are nothing but endpoints used to measure variables on a personâ€™s face, which includes the length and width of the nose, cheekbone shape, and eye socket depth.

Techniques for face recognition:

While humans can recognize faces without much effort, facial recognition is a challenging pattern recognition problem in computing. Facial recognition systems attempt to identify a human face, which is three-dimensional and changes in appearance with lighting and facial expression, based on its two-dimensional image. To accomplish this computational task, facial recognition systems perform four steps. First face detection is used to segment the face from the image background. In the second step the segmented face image is aligned to account for face pose, image size and photographic properties, such as illumination and grayscale. The purpose of the alignment process is to enable the accurate localization of facial features in the third step, the facial feature extraction. Features such as eyes, nose and mouth are pinpointed and measured in the image to represent the face. The so established feature vector of the face is then, in the fourth step, matched against a database of faces.
